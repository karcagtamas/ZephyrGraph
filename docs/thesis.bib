This paper gives detail about this technique of software testing. It also shows how the CEG technique can be used to test that software fulfill requirement specification or not.

  title        = {A Systematic Review of Automated Test Data Generation Techniques},

  abstractnote = {Automated Test Data Generation (ATDG) is an activity that in the course of software testing automatically generates test data for the software under test (SUT). It usually makes the testing more efficient and cost effective. Test Data Generation (TDG) is crucial for software testing because test data is one of the key factors for determining the quality of any software test during its execution. The multi-phased activity of ATDG involves various techniques for each of its phases. This research field is not new by any means, albeit lately new techniques have been devised and a gradual increase in the level of maturity has brought some diversified trends into it. To this end several ATDG techniques are available, but emerging trends in computing have raised the necessity to summarize and assess the current status of this area particularly for practitioners, future researchers and students. Further, analysis of the ATDG techniques becomes even more important when Miller et al. [4] highlight the hardship in general acceptance of these techniques. Under this scenario only a systematic review can address the issues because systematic reviews provide evaluation and interpretation of all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. This thesis, by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology, provides a systematic review that is aimed at presenting a fair evaluation of research concerning ATDG techniques of the period 1997-2006. Moreover it also aims at identifying probable gaps in research about ATDG techniques of defined period so as to suggest the scope for further research. This systematic review is basically presented on the pattern of [5 and 8] and follows the techniques suggested by [1].The articles published in journals and conference proceedings during the defined period are of concern in this review. The motive behind this selection is quite logical in the sense that the techniques that are discussed in literature of this period might reflect their suitability for the prevailing software environment of today and are believed to fulfill the needs of foreseeable future. Furthermore only automated and/or semiautomated ATDG techniques have been chosen for consideration while leaving the manual techniques as they are out of the scope. As a result of the preliminary study the review identifies ATDG techniques and relevant articles of the defined period whereas the detailed study evaluates and interprets all available research relevant to ATDG techniques. For interpretation and elaboration of the discovered ATDG techniques a novel approach called ``Natural Clustering'' is introduced. To accomplish the task of systematic review a comprehensive research method has been developed. Then on the practical implications of this research method important results have been gained. These results have been presented in statistical/numeric, diagrammatic, and descriptive forms. Additionally the thesis also introduces various criterions for classification of the discovered ATDG techniques and presents a comprehensive analysis of the results of these techniques. Some interesting facts have also been highlighted during the course of discussion. Finally, the discussion culminates with inferences and recommendations which emanate from this analysis. As the research work produced in the thesis is based on a rich amount of trustworthy information, therefore, it could also serve the purpose of being an upto- date guide about ATDG techniques.},

  abstract   = {Turing Lecture from the winners of the 2007 ACM A.M. Turing Award.In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of model checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model---representing, for example, a hardware or software design---satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic (TL) formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem.The progression of model checking to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past 28 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a result many major hardware and software companies are beginning to use model checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits, communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms.The work of Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms, and surprising theoretical results. Model checking tools, created by both academic and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance regarding the correctness of their initial designs. Model checking promises to have an even greater impact on the hardware and software industries in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Moshe Y. Vardi, Editor-in-Chief},
